## Why?
I needed something, what could manage multiple game versions, make modpacks and look good - so I came up with this.

## Roadmap
Mid/late May - First mod management implementations  
Mid June - Add some basic animations  
Mid/Late June - Alpha release  
Early July - Create CI environment  
Mid-Late July - Beta release  
Later - We will see  

## Contributing
Todo. For now just use your intuition and describe problem clearly.
